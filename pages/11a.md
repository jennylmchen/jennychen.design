# Spatial Projection
Studio Project (Fall 2019) <br>
**Materials**: Bristol, Canson Paper (300gsm) <br>
**Tools**: Rhino 3D, Adobe Illustrator
	
**Part I - PROJECTED MODULATION**: line-to-solid and back again <br>
	
<p> This project was an introduction to the theories and techniques of orthographic projection as the primary means of representation in architecture. By using 2D to 3D projection, we created a series of 8 solids. </p>

**Part II - SPATIAL CONSTURUCT**: solid-to-surface and back again </p>
	
<p> Boolean operations and part-to-part aggregations start to transition the solid into surfaces and spaces. The introduction of interiority, scale, and
architectural figures, such as staircases are added to the object to give it a sense of scale. </p>

My project focuses on ascension, with narrow forms twisting and turning as they rise up to the full 12-inch of the object. This contrasts with the circulation path, which ascends more gradually, in a circumambulatory fashion and with rounded angles.
