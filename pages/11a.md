<p> This project was an introduction to the theories and techniques of orthographic projection as the primary means of representation in architecture. By using 2D to 3D projection, we created a series of 8 solids. They were then assembled to form a larger architectural object. A plinth and staircases are added to the object to give it a sense of scale. <br>

My project focuses on ascension, with narrow forms twisting and turning as they rise up to the full 12-inch of the object. This contrasts with the circulation path, which ascends more gradually, in a circumambulatory fashion and with rounded angles.
