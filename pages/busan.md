# The Urban Designer's Guide to the Nature's Edge
<p>Studio Project (Summer 2023)<br>
Site: Busan, South Korea <p>

<p> The oceanfront marks the border between the water and the land, the openness and the definite, the
resources and the consumers, the threat and the shelter. This workshop will not look at one single
metropolis usually defined by a land area, but instead a broad region connected by open waters, from
western Japan to southern Korea. After reading through the regionâ€™s history and contemporary urban
conditions, we will arrive at a series of experimental design exercises, at human scale. Hyperobjects. </p>
