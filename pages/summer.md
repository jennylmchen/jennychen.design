## Summer

This is a personal project I made during my time on a Gold Team in Innovative Design, a pro-bono creative agency that helps make Berkeley beautiful. 
The theme for this project is typography. I wanted to explore how text can be deformed and cast shadows on water. Colors and reflections help contribute to a dreamy, summery vibe.
