## Summer

Club Project (Fall 2020)<br>
**Tools**: Sketchup, Procreate, Adobe Photoshop<br>
**Duration**: 2 weeks

<p> This is a personal project I made during my time on a Gold Team in Innovative Design, a pro-bono creative agency that helps make Berkeley beautiful. 
The theme for this project is typography. I wanted to explore how text can be deformed and cast shadows on water. Colors and reflections help contribute to a dreamy, summery vibe. </p>
