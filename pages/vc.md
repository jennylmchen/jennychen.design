<p> Eight ordinary buildings in Syracuse were recreated in a hand-made models. The use of abstraction, textures and imprecise edges creates a feeling of vernacularity. </p>

<p> The other component of the exhibition is an eighty-foot scroll drawing that depicts the city in the axonometric style of a traditional Chinese scroll painting. The lack of specific origin point allows scenes to flow seamlessly across the page. </p>

<p> Like many other post-industrial cities in America, Syracuse has an evidently car-centric approach to urban design. The road network, intended to connect spaces, ended up dividing communities instead. The demolition of highway I-81 has been a topic of debate for many years. Its elevated section is a physical and social barrier, which splits the city into East and West sides, further exacerbating income, demographic and development inequality between the two halves. 

We chose to depict three distinct types of roads found in Syracuse. In the first third of the drawing, the driver is on an elevated highway. Bold lines cut through the scroll. These dramatic perspective shifts reflect the experience of landscape flying by when moving at high speeds. In between the concrete structures, pockets of neighborhoods and industrial areas can be briefly glimpsed.

The middle of the drawing prominently features Erie Boulevard. This is a busy arterial road embellished with traffic signs. Drivers travel with a purpose, only slowing down to appreciate their surroundings when they encounter a red light. The road is lined with community spaces such as restaurants and churches, as well as buildings auxiliary to the driving experience, such as gas stations, drive-thru restaurants, and auto repair shops. Most of these buildings have obvious additions, renovations and repaints, reflecting how they withstood changes that have taken place in the city over time. They are a testament to the resilience of the city and its people. 

Finally, as we approach the residential area, smaller winding paths lead us to suburban houses, idyllic fields and parks. As the journey comes to a halt, reflections in the car windows reveal the spaces that are more walkable and community centric.
