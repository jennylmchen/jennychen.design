<p style="text-align: justify">
Hi! I am a recent M Arch graduate. A background in architecture helps me visualize space/objects in both 2D and 3D. I am also trained to create solutions that respond to real, human needs. I am interested in product and graphic design, data-driven urban design, and everything else in between. Currently looking forward to my next creative outlet.

In my free time, I <a href="http://www.urbansketchers.org/">walk around with a sketchbook</a>, figure skate,  dance, play video games, and hunt for the next hobby that I will spend all my time on for a while but leave it in a corner to collect dust.
